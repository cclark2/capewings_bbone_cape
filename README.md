CapeWings BeagleBone Cape
=========================

Breaks down cape stacks into a form factor easier to debug without having to keep removing capes. Supports selectively jumpering signals between the BeagleBone and up to three capes. Also allows multiple BeagleBones to be connected together. It's a cape developer's dream!
